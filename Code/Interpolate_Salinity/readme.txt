Folders made for Functions (used in the Interpolate_Salinity Code) as well as exploratory analyses (Exploratory) -
Exploratory includes code that was used when trying to understand which methods to use, as well as useful tidbits
of code that were worth saving, but ultimately were not used in any of the analyses.

Exploratory/Interpolate_Salinity_Example.R was sent by Mike O'brian from https://github.com/mhpob/TelemetryR/blob/master/R/CBinterp.R,
Ass well as with CBP.
This example is actually an interpolation for temperature that I will have to apply.
